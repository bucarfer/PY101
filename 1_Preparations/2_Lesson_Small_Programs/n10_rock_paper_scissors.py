'''In this assignment, we'll build a Rock Paper Scissors game. Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game played between two opponents.
Both opponents choose an item from rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is decided according to the following rules:

If player a chooses rock and player b chooses scissors, player a wins.
If player a chooses paper and player b chooses rock, player a wins.
If player a chooses scissors and player b chooses paper, player a wins.
If both players choose the same item, neither player wins. It's a tie.
Our version of the game lets the user play against the computer. The game flow should go like this:

The user makes a choice.
The computer makes a choice.
The winner is displayed.'''

## Bonus question 2. Shortened Input Typing the full word "rock" or "lizard" is tiring. Update the program so the user can type "r" for "rock," "p" for "paper," and so on.
# Note that if you do bonus #1, you'll have two words that start with "s." How do you resolve that?

#Bonus 2. Define the abbreviations and their correspondence full name

CHOICES = {
    'r' : 'rock',
    'p' : 'paper',
    's' : 'scissors',
    'l' : 'lizard',
    'k' : 'spock',
}

# Bonus 3. Best of Five Keep score of the player's and computer's wins. When either the player or computer reaches three wins, the match is over, and the winning player becomes the grand winner.
# Don't add your incrementing logic to display_winner. Keep your functions simple; they should perform one logical task -- no more, no less.

##Bonus questions

# 1. Notice how the display_winner function calls the prompt function. What happens if you move the display_winner function definition above the prompt function definition? Does it still work?

# No itÂ´s stop working, we need to call the function with the variables, once the variables have been defined.

# 2. How would you use the display_winner function differently if it returned a string, as opposed to outputting the string directly?

# I would print the function -> print(display_winner(choice, computer_choice))

# 3. We used a while loop with an always-true condition and a break statement to decide whether to replay the game. Can you rewrite the loop so that we don't need to use the break statement to stop the loop?

# if answer.startwith('y') or answer.startwith('n')
# if answer[0] != 'n'

# To rewrite the loop without using a break statement, you can modify the condition of the while loop to check a variable that determines whether to continue playing. Here's how you can solve this:

## Initialize a variable to control the game loop
# play_again = True

## Use the variable in the while condition instead of True
# while play_again:
#     prompt(f'Choose one: {", ".join(VALID_CHOICES)}')
#     choice = input()

#     while choice not in VALID_CHOICES:
#         prompt("That's not a valid choice")
#         choice = input()

#     computer_choice = random.choice(VALID_CHOICES)
#     display_winner(choice, computer_choice)

#     valid_answer = False
#     while not valid_answer:
#         prompt("Do you want to play again (y/n)?")
#         answer = input().lower()

#         if answer.startswith('n') or answer.startswith('y'):
#             valid_answer = True
#         else:
#             prompt("That's not a valid choice")

#     # Set play_again based on the user's answer
#     play_again = answer.startswith('y')

#### Bonus 1.
# Lizard Spock This game is a variation on the Rock Paper Scissors game that adds two more options - Lizard and Spock. The full explanation and rules are here. There's also a hilarious Big Bang Theory video about it here.

# The goal of this bonus is to add Lizard and Spock to your game.

# My original approach below was adding more options to the display_winner but unfortunately is too long, we need to create a dictionary instead with a

# def display_winner(player, computer):
#     prompt(f'you chose {player}, the computer chose {computer}')

#     if ((player == 'rock' and computer == 'scissors') or
#         (player == 'paper' and computer == 'rock') or
#         (player == 'scissors' and computer == 'paper') or
#         (player == 'rock' and computer == 'lizard') or
#         (player == 'lizard' and computer == 'spock') or
#         (player == 'spock' and computer == 'scissors') or
#         (player == 'scissors' and computer == 'lizard') or
#         (player == 'lizard' and computer == 'paper') or
#         (player == 'paper' and computer == 'spock') or
#         (player == 'spock' and computer == 'rock')):
#         prompt('You win!!')
#     elif ((computer == 'rock' and player == 'scissors') or
#           (computer == 'paper' and player == 'rock') or
#           (computer == 'scissors' and player == 'paper') or
#           (computer == 'rock' and player == 'lizard') or
